# David Gardiner

I've been been creating software for over 25 years. I have a passion for continual learning and improving quality, and enjoy being in and creating environments where these happen. A [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001655) (Development Technologies), I run the [Adelaide .NET User Group](https://www.adnug.net).

Based in Adelaide, South Australia, I works as a Senior Software Developer at [RLDatix](https://www.rldatix.com) on healthcare software. In my spare time I contribute to numerous open source projects, and am a package moderator at [Chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org)

I blog at [https://david.gardiner.net.au](https://david.gardiner.net.au) and tweet at [@DavidRGardiner](https://twitter.com/DavidRGardiner).
